# TencentCloud Auth Method

The `tencentcloud` auth method provides an automated mechanism to retrieve
a Vault token for TencentCloud entities. Unlike most Vault auth methods, this
method does not require manual first-deploying, or provisioning
security-sensitive credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates,
etc), by operators. It treats TencentCloud as a Trusted Third Party and uses a
special TencentCloud request signed with private credentials.

## Authentication Workflow

The TencentCloud STS API includes a method, `sts:GetCallerIdentity`,
which allows you to validate the identity of a client. The client signs
a `GetCallerIdentity` query using the [TencentCloud signature
algorithm](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/33224). It then
submits 3 pieces of information to the Vault server to recreate a valid signed
request: the role name, the request URL, and the request headers. The Vault server then
reconstructs the query and forwards it on to the TencentCloud STS service and validates
the result back.

Each signed TencentCloud request includes the current timestamp and a nonce to mitigate
the risk of replay attacks.

It's also important to note that TencentCloud does NOT include any sort
of authorization around calls to `GetCallerIdentity`. For example, if you have
a CAM policy on your credential that requires all access to be MFA authenticated,
non-MFA authenticated credentials will still be able to authenticate to Vault
using this method. It does not appear possible to enforce a CAM principal to be
MFA authenticated while authenticating to Vault.

## Authorization Workflow

The basic mechanism of operation is per-role.

Roles are associated with a role ARN that has been pre-created in TencentCloud.
TencentCloud's console displays each role's ARN.

When a client sends its `GetCallerIdentity` request to Vault, Vault matches the
arn of a pre-created role in Vault. It then checks what policies have been
associated with the role, and grants a token accordingly.

## Authentication

### Via the CLI

#### Enable TencentCloud authentication in Vault.

```sh
$ vault auth enable tencentcloud
```

#### Configure the policies on the role.

```sh
$ vault write auth/tencentcloud/role/dev-role arn='qcs::cam::uin/12345678:roleName/testRoleName'
```

#### Perform the login operation

```sh
$ vault write auth/tencentcloud/login \
        role=dev-role \
        request_url=c3RzLnRlb23454jbG91ZGFwaS5jb20= \
        signed_header=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
```

- The `request_url` is base64 encoded, and the raw url is like `sts.ap-guangzhou.tencentcloudapi.com`.
- The `signed_header` is base64 encoded, and it is an HTTP header like
```json
{"Authorization":["TC3-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=test/2020-09-02/sts/tc3_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host, Signature=alkjf324qljtrqlktjq1jgasaj"],"Content-Type":["application/json"],"X-Tc-Action":["GetCallerIdentity"],"X-Tc-Language":["zh-CN"],"X-Tc-Region":["ap-guangzhou"],"X-Tc-Requestclient":["test"],"X-Tc-Timestamp":["1599035664"],"X-Tc-Version":["2017-03-12"]}
```

For the CAM auth method, generating the signed request is a non-standard operation.
The Vault CLI supports generating this for you:

```sh
$ vault login -method=tencentcloud access_key=... secret_key=... security_token=... region=...
```
